# Basic_C-_Programs
 Here are some small C# Projects I made while learning C#

### Car Insurance
This project involves developing an MVC web application designed to simulate a car insurance website. It processes user inputs regarding policy details and generates quotes using predefined business logic. Additionally, the application includes an administrative interface, enabling staff members to review all issued quotes.

### Twenty One
This project involves developing a console application designed to simulate the card game "21" (Blackjack). It manages player inputs for joining games and placing bets, and automates dealer actions using predefined game rules. Additionally, the application includes an administrative mode, allowing for the review of logged exceptions and game events.
